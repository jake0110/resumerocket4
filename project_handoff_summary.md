   - Enhanced error feedback

3. Implement error handling (Completed)
   - Added invalid API key detection
   - Implemented network timeout handling
   - Added user-friendly error messages

### Phase 2: Testing
1. Test resume upload:
   - Verify file size limits
   - Test different .docx formats
   - Verify error messages for invalid files

2. Test OpenAI integration:
   - Verify API connection
   - Test response parsing
   - Verify error handling

3. Test combined functionality:

   - Login to Replit
   - Open ResumeRocket5 project
   - Wait for Streamlit server to auto-start

2. Verify Environment:
   - Check Streamlit server status
   - Verify Python packages
   - Have OpenAI API key ready

3. Test Functionality:
   - Navigate to resume upload page
   - Enter OpenAI API key
   - Upload test resume
   - Verify analysis results
