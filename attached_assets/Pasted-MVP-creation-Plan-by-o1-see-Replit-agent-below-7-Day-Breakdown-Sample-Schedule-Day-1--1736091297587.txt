MVP creation 

Plan by o1 see Replit agent below 
 
7-Day Breakdown (Sample Schedule) 

Day 1 

Setup project repo, basic hosting environment (Vercel or Heroku). 

Create landing page skeleton. 

Day 2 

Implement file upload endpoint. 

Integrate quick resume parsing method (even if minimal). 

Day 3 

Build the multi-step question form. 

Store user answers in an in-memory or lightweight database (SQLite/postgres). 

Day 4 

Integrate LLM API for text generation. 

Test the pipeline end-to-end (upload → parse → Q&A → generate text). 

Day 5 

Implement a basic page to display the improved resume. 

Add a “Download as PDF” or “Copy to Clipboard” feature. 

Day 6 

Basic UI cleanup: add error messages, placeholders, minimal styling. 

Testing with a small group (friends/colleagues). Collect feedback. 

Day 7 

Final polish and bug fixes. 

Deploy to live environment. Provide link to first round of real users.

Feasibility & Tips 

Feasibility: Achievable if you keep the scope laser-focused. One developer with experience in front-end, back-end, and basic AI integration could do this in 7 intense days, especially using existing libraries and boilerplates. 

Tips: 

Use a “low-code” or “no-code” approach for front-end to save time, or a quick React template. 

Lean on external APIs heavily (resume parsing, LLM). Don’t reinvent the wheel. 

Accept that your design will be minimal and your question set might be less dynamic to meet the deadline.

Final Thoughts 

A 7-day MVP is all about focusing on the must-have features: 

Upload 

Supplementary questions 

AI text enhancement 

Simple output 

All other elements—user accounts, advanced styling, analytics, robust error handling—can come after real users start giving feedback. This approach ensures you have a functioning, testable product in a short time frame, letting you iterate quickly based on real-world usage.
