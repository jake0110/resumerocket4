## Recent Development Progress

### Parser Implementation Challenges
1. Contact Information Extraction
   - Inconsistent name detection across different resume formats
   - Variable success rate with email and phone extraction
   - Location parsing proved particularly challenging with non-standard formats

2. Document Structure Handling
   - Traditional resume formats (e.g., Emily Carver) parsed partially successfully
   - Non-traditional formats (e.g., Melinda West) failed to parse correctly
   - Complex formatting and unique structures caused extraction failures

### Technical Implementation Status
1. Core Infrastructure
   - Streamlit frontend successfully implemented
   - File upload functionality working as expected
   - OpenAI API integration remains stable

2. Parser Components
   - Enhanced pattern matching attempted but with limited success
   - Improved error handling and logging implemented
   - Multiple parsing strategies tested with inconsistent results

## Decision Points & Path Forward

### Key Findings
1. Current Approach Limitations
   - Pattern-based extraction proves unreliable for varied formats
   - AI enhancement shows promise but needs better integration
   - Error handling improvements haven't resolved core parsing issues

2. Technology Evaluation
   - Current pattern matching approach insufficient for requirements
   - Need for more specialized document parsing solutions identified
   - Potential for hybrid approach combining multiple technologies

### Strategic Decision
After thorough evaluation and testing, the decision has been made to:
1. Discontinue current parsing implementation
2. Preserve core functionality (upload, AI integration)
3. Prepare for integration with specialized parsing solution

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Code Cleanup
   - Remove current parsing implementation
   - Maintain document upload functionality
   - Preserve AI integration capabilities

2. Architecture Preparation
   - Modularize remaining components
   - Prepare integration points for new parser
   - Document requirements for new solution

### Short-term Goals
1. Evaluate specialized parsing solutions
2. Design new integration architecture
3. Implement improved validation methods

## Technical Specifications

### Current Environment
- Python 3.11
- Streamlit 1.28.1
- Key Dependencies:
  - python-docx 1.0.1
  - python-dotenv 1.0.0
  - requests 2.31.0

### Configuration
