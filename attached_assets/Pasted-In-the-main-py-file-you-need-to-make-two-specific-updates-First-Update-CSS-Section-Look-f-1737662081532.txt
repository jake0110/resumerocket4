In the main.py file, you need to make two specific updates:

First Update - CSS Section:

Look for the CSS styles section that starts with st.markdown("""<style>
Find the existing CSS classes .requirements-container, .requirement-text, and .stCheckbox
Replace those specific classes with the new CSS code I'm providing
Don't change any other CSS classes

Second Update - Requirements Content:

Look for the section after # Requirements Section and st.title("Eligibility Requirements")
Find the three requirement blocks that start with # First Requirement, # Second Requirement, and # Third Requirement
Replace these three blocks with the new code I'm providing
Don't change any other content sections

Important Notes:

Only replace these specific sections
Keep all other code exactly as is
Make sure to maintain proper indentation
If you're unsure about anything, please ask before making changes

Would you like me to provide the code with more context to show exactly where these changes should go?" CopyRetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.

In the CSS section, update/replace only this part:
/* Main container for requirements section /
.requirements-container {
margin-top: 0.5rem; / Reduced top margin /
padding: 0.5rem; / Reduced padding */
}

/* Text container */
.requirement-text {
flex: 1;
margin: 0;
line-height: 1.4;
padding: 0.25rem 0;
display: flex;
align-items: center;
}

/* Checkbox container adjustment /
.stCheckbox {
margin: 0 !important;
padding: 0 !important;
transform: translateY(-2px) !important; / Fine-tuned checkbox alignment */
}

In the content section, update only these three requirement blocks:
First Requirement
col1, col2 = st.columns([0.9, 0.1])
with col1:
st.markdown("""
<div class="requirement-text">
I have worked as a management consultant within the past two years.
</div>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
with col2:
st.checkbox("", key="consultant_check", label_visibility="collapsed")

Second Requirement
col1, col2 = st.columns([0.9, 0.1])
with col1:
st.markdown("""
<div class="requirement-text">
I am actively or passively seeking new employment opportunities.
</div>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
with col2:
st.checkbox("", key="seeking_check", label_visibility="collapsed")

Third Requirement
col1, col2 = st.columns([0.9, 0.1])
with col1:
st.markdown("""
<div class="requirement-text">
I commit to providing detailed feedback and suggestions.
</div>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
with col2:
st.checkbox("", key="feedback_check", label_visibility="collapsed")
