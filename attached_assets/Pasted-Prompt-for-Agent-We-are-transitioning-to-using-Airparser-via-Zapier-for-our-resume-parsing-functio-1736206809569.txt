Prompt for Agent:

We are transitioning to using Airparser via Zapier for our resume parsing functionality. To do this, I need you to prepare the app for integration by following these steps:

Remove Current Parsing Implementation:

Delete all code, dependencies, and configurations related to the existing resume parsing logic.
Ensure the following components remain intact:
File upload functionality in the Streamlit frontend.
The existing OpenAI API integration for potential future use.
Double-check that no residual parsing code interferes with the new integration.
Prepare for Airparser-Zapier Integration:

Set up the app to send uploaded resumes to Airparser via Zapier for parsing.
Ensure the app can receive parsed data back from Zapier (e.g., names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, and previous employer details) and display or store it appropriately.
Identify any specific input/output format requirements for Airparser and ensure compatibility.
Integration Workflow:

Create a Zap in Zapier to:
Trigger when a resume is uploaded.
Send the resume to Airparser for parsing.
Return parsed results to the app for further processing or storage.
Document the workflow steps in case future adjustments are needed.
Git Rollback (if needed):

If removing the parsing code introduces issues, roll back to an earlier build from Git where parsing was not yet implemented.
Reapply any unrelated improvements from subsequent commits that are not tied to the previous parsing logic.
Testing and Debugging:

Test the integration end-to-end with both traditional and non-traditional resume formats.
Verify that parsed data is accurate and appears correctly in the app.
Document any errors or edge cases that may require adjustment in the Zapier workflow.
Modular Architecture:

Ensure the app is modular to allow easy swapping or upgrading of parsing solutions in the future.
Clearly define integration points for Airparser and document them for future developers.
Documentation:

Update the project summary to reflect the removal of the old parsing logic and the integration with Airparser via Zapier.
Include steps for setting up and maintaining the Zapier workflow.
Let me know when the integration is complete, and share any blockers or questions as you progress. If additional resources or clarification are needed, feel free to ask.
