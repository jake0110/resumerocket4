Summary for Agent: Current Status and Next Steps
Current Status
We have set up a workflow using Make.com to process data from the Streamlit app. Here’s the current structure and progress:

Workflow Overview:

Webhooks captures form submissions and file uploads from the Streamlit app.
Router splits the flow:
Attachments (e.g., resumes) are routed to AirParser for parsing.
All other form data (text inputs, dropdown selections) is routed directly to Google Sheets.
AirParser:
Configured to parse resumes (attachments) and route the parsed data to Google Sheets.
Google Sheets:
Predefined column headers are set up manually.
Mapped fields include first_name, last_name, email, phone, city, state, and date_created.
Streamlit Integration:

The Streamlit app is partially configured with a form to capture user inputs:
Text Inputs: First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone.
Dropdowns: City, State, and Professional Level.
File Upload: Resume as a .pdf or .docx file.
Submission Timestamp (date_created) is captured automatically.
Key Functionality Added:

Form submission handler sends form data and file attachments to the Webhook URL.
Resumes are processed by AirParser; parsed details are auto-filled back into the form.
Error handling is in place for file uploads, resume parsing, and webhook submission failures.
What We Want to Accomplish Next
Complete Streamlit Integration:

Finalize the connection between the Streamlit app and Make.com Webhook.
Ensure all form fields (first_name, last_name, email, phone, city, state, professional_level, and date_created) are correctly sent to Webhooks.
Test file uploads (resumes) to verify they are routed to AirParser.
Validation:

Test the end-to-end workflow:
Verify text and dropdown inputs are stored correctly in Google Sheets.
Confirm parsed resume data is returned from AirParser and correctly mapped to Google Sheets.
Ensure fallback routes handle missing or invalid data appropriately.
Finalize Google Sheets Configuration:

Add any missing fields to the Google Sheets column headers.
Confirm that the mappings in the Google Sheets module match the Streamlit form fields.
Test Full Workflow:

Submit sample data through Streamlit.
Validate that:
Attachments are routed to AirParser.
All non-attachment data is routed directly to Google Sheets.
Code Update Details
The following code updates have been added to the Streamlit app:

Webhook Integration:
send_to_webhook() function sends form data and resumes to the Make.com Webhook.
Uses requests.post() to handle file uploads and data submission.
Form Handling:
Form fields for name, email, phone, city, and state are rendered.
Resume uploads are validated and processed with AirParser integration.
Error Handling:
Includes validation for missing webhook URL and file upload size limits.
Next Steps for the Agent
Test Streamlit Submission:

Submit form data (with and without file uploads) to the Webhook.
Verify that:
Text inputs and dropdown values reach Google Sheets.
Attachments (resumes) are routed to AirParser.
Debug and Refine:

Address any issues in data mapping or Webhook communication.
Ensure seamless data flow from Streamlit to the respective outputs.
Complete Workflow Validation:

Validate the full pipeline: Streamlit ➡️ Webhooks ➡️ Router ➡️ AirParser/Google Sheets.
Let me know if there’s anything else you need clarified!
