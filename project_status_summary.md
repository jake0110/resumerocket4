## Current Configuration

### OpenAI Integration
```python
client = OpenAI()  # Using environment variables for configuration
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a precise resume parser..."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ],
    response_format={"type": "json_object"}
)
```

### File Processing
- Maximum file size: 200MB
- Supported format: .docx
- Temporary file handling implemented
- Automatic cleanup after processing

## Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Improve Resume Parsing (Current)
1. Enhance AI prompt for better information extraction
2. Add validation for extracted fields
3. Implement fallback mechanisms for failed extractions
4. Add detailed logging for debugging

### Phase 2: Testing & Validation
1. Create test suite with sample resumes
2. Verify extraction accuracy
3. Test error handling scenarios
4. Measure and optimize response times

### Phase 3: UI Enhancement
1. Add loading indicators
2. Improve error messages
3. Add field validation feedback
4. Implement retry mechanisms

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Current Issues
1. Inconsistent contact information extraction
   - Solution: Refining AI prompts and adding validation
2. OpenAI client initialization errors
   - Solution: Simplified client configuration using environment variables
3. Response parsing reliability
   - Solution: Adding structured validation and error handling

### Resolved Issues
1. ✅ OpenAI client proxies error
2. ✅ File upload size limitations
3. ✅ Temporary file cleanup

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Refine AI prompts for better extraction accuracy
2. Implement comprehensive error handling
3. Add field validation and data cleaning
4. Enhance logging for better debugging

### Future Enhancements
1. Add support for additional file formats
2. Implement batch processing capabilities
3. Add export functionality
4. Create detailed parsing analytics

## Technical Notes
