# ResumeRocket5 Project Status Summary - January 06, 2025

## Chat Summary & Progress

### Recent Debugging Steps:
1. Installed and verified core dependencies:
   - streamlit==1.28.1
   - python-docx==1.0.1
   - openai==1.3.8
   - requests==2.31.0

2. Enhanced resume parsing logic:
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Enhanced pattern matching for contact information
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

3. Server Configuration:
   - Updated Streamlit configuration for proper server binding
   - Configured logging levels and formats

### Current Issues:

1. Server Startup:
   - Streamlit server is experiencing startup issues
   - Configuration has been updated but requires further debugging

2. Parsing Functionality:
   - Contact information extraction needs improvement
   - Name extraction logic picking up incorrect text blocks
   - Email and phone fields not being consistently extracted

## Tests Conducted

1. OpenAI Integration:
   - Previous working integration confirmed
   - API connection functionality verified
   - Integration currently stable but needs proper error handling

2. Resume Parsing Tests:
   - Document upload functionality tested
   - Field extraction partially working
   - Name extraction producing incorrect results
   - Email/phone extraction needs verification

## Current Configuration

### Environment Setup:
- Python 3.11
- Streamlit server configured for port 5000
- OpenAI SDK latest version installed
- Logging configured for detailed debugging

### Key Components:
1. Resume Parser:
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Improved pattern matching
   - Detailed logging implementation

2. Server Configuration:
   - Headless mode enabled
   - CORS disabled for development
   - Custom port configuration (5000)

## Known Issues & Root Cause Analysis

1. Parser Issues:
   - Name extraction logic needs refinement
   - Pattern matching may be too restrictive
   - Document processing needs better error handling

2. Hypotheses:
   - Field extraction patterns may need adjustment
   - Text preprocessing might be affecting pattern matching
   - Document structure parsing needs improvement

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. Fix Streamlit server startup issues:
   - Verify configuration
   - Check port availability
   - Review error logs

2. Enhance parsing logic:
   - Refine name extraction patterns
   - Implement stricter validation for contact fields
   - Add debug logging for field extraction

### Short-term Goals:
1. Implement robust error handling
2. Add validation for parsed fields
3. Improve logging for debugging
4. Test with various resume formats

### Medium-term Improvements:
1. Add fallback parsing methods
2. Implement field validation
3. Add user feedback mechanisms
4. Enhance error reporting
