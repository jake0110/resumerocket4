# ResumeRocket5 Project Status Summary - January 09, 2025

## Chat Summary & Progress

### Debugging Session Overview
1. **Webhook Integration Fixes**
   - Identified and resolved secrets.toml configuration issues
   - Updated webhook URL format from `rwax3krv6kqd8pcf6t59ngpdaltu88kz@hook.us2.make.com` to `https://hook.us2.make.com/rwax3krv6kqd8pcf6t59ngpdaltu88kz`
   - Enhanced webhook error handling and logging in main.py
   - Modified secrets access path from `st.secrets.get()` to `st.secrets["general"]["MAKE_WEBHOOK_URL"]`

2. **Server Configuration Updates**
   - Implemented proper Streamlit server configuration
   - Added debug-level logging for better error tracking
   - Successfully restarted server with new configurations

### Current System State
- Form submission functionality implemented
- File upload component working
- Make.com webhook integration configured
- Enhanced error logging implemented

## Tests Conducted

### Integration Tests
1. **Form Submission Testing**
   - Tested with sample user data (name, email, phone, location)
   - Verified file upload functionality
   - Monitored webhook response handling

### Configuration Tests
1. **Secrets Management**
   - Verified secrets.toml file structure
   - Tested webhook URL accessibility
   - Confirmed proper secrets loading in Streamlit

## Current Configuration

### Environment Setup
- Python 3.11
- Streamlit 1.29.0
- OpenAI SDK (latest version)
- Running on port 8501

### Key Dependencies
```toml
dependencies = [
    "streamlit==1.29.0",
    "openai==1.6.1",
    "requests==2.31.0",
    "python-dotenv==1.0.0"
]
```

## Known Issues & Hypotheses

### Current Challenges
1. **Webhook Integration**
   - Form submission errors persist despite configuration updates
   - Potential issues with payload formatting or webhook endpoint compatibility
   - Need to verify Make.com webhook endpoint functionality

2. **Error Handling**
   - Enhanced logging implemented to better track issues
   - Monitoring server logs for detailed error messages
   - Added response content logging for better debugging

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Webhook Debugging**
   - Implement webhook response validation
   - Add payload verification before submission
   - Test webhook endpoint independently

2. **Error Handling Enhancement**
   - Add try-catch blocks for specific error scenarios
   - Implement user-friendly error messages
   - Add detailed logging for webhook responses

3. **Testing Plan**
   - Create test cases for different form submission scenarios
   - Verify file upload size limits and formats
   - Test error handling for various edge cases

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Resilience**
   - Implement retry mechanism for failed submissions
   - Add request timeout handling
   - Implement proper error recovery

2. **User Experience**
   - Add loading states during submission
   - Improve error message clarity
   - Implement form validation feedback

This summary reflects the current state as of January 09, 2025. The focus remains on resolving webhook integration issues and improving error handling for a more robust application.
